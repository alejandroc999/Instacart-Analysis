Instacart Data Analysis Project

Main Objective

THe main goal of this project is to explore consumer patterns and user habits as well as sales trends in order to craft targeted and data backed marketing strategies. 

Instacart, a leading online grocery platform, is poised to elevate its marketing strategies. Recognizing the limitations of a uniform approach, the company is eager to uncover tailored solutions via data analysis. My objective is to meticulously segment customers and devise bespoke strategies to optimize product sales.

Key Questions

What are the peak order times and days?
When do customers tend to spend the most?
How can product price ranges improve marketing strategies?
Which product departments are most popular?
How do customer demographics and behaviors vary in terms of brand loyalty, regional differences, and purchasing patterns?

The project leverages open-source datasets from Instacart, complemented by specially created customer datasets.
